# Description 
A LinkedIn website home page clone, the major layout of the project
is CSS grid, it shows the basic dynamics of the website.

It shows different segments of the webpage like a mini CV,
User profile, comments, suggestions for people you might
Like to connect with etc.

Its main header links and icons have a nice translateY()
Transform effect.

The website isn't yet responsive on a host of several devices but I hope to work on that in the nearest future.
